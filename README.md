Virtual Internship Task 3 And last 

🚀 Excited to Share My Latest Project! 🚀

I’ve just completed Task 3 of my internship at CodSoft, where I designed a sleek and simple landing page for an e-commerce website. 🌐✨

The landing page features a clean and modern design that showcases essential elements for an online store. It was a great opportunity to apply my HTML and CSS skills and delve into the world of e-commerce design. 💻🎨

Looking forward to more challenging tasks ahead and continuing to grow in the web development space! 🌟
